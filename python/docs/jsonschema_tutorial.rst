Tutorial: Converting CSV to MCAP with JSON
******************************************

Introduction
------------

In this tutorial we'll take a publicly available dataset and demonstrate how to convert it from a
CSV format to an MCAP file. We'll use Python and JSON to quickly create messages without requiring
extra serialization libraries or generated code.

You can run all the code in this tutorial or reference it
`in the MCAP repo <https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/tree/main/python/examples/jsonschema/pointcloud_csv_to_mcap.py>`_.

Decoding the data source
------------------------

This tutorial uses the public CSV dataset
`"Sydney Urban Objects Dataset" <https://www.acfr.usyd.edu.au/papers/SydneyUrbanObjectsDataset.shtml>`_,
released by the **Australian Centre for Field Robotics** at the University of Sydney.
This is a collection of CSV files containing point clouds collected from objects on the street.

Decoding the data is pretty simple, thanks to Python's built-in ``csv`` and ``datetime`` libraries:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/jsonschema/pointcloud_csv_to_mcap.py
    :start-after: # tutorial-csv-decode-start
    :end-before: # tutorial-csv-decode-end

Creating a ``foxglove.PointCloud``
----------------------------------

To view this point cloud, we must encode these points in a way that Foxglove Studio
understands. To facilitate this, Foxglove Studio provides a collection of message schemas that
it knows how to display. These are available for a variety of serializations
`on GitHub <https://github.com/foxglove/schemas>`_. For this tutorial, we'll focus on building a
JSON ``PointCloud`` instance, using the provided 
`schema <https://github.com/foxglove/schemas/blob/main/schemas/jsonschema/PointCloud.json>`_.

Let's start with encoding the point data. The schema expects a single ``base64``-encoded buffer
containing all point data, and some metadata describing how to decode it.

The CSV data contains one timestamp and four floating-point data fields per point.
``foxglove.PointCloud`` uses one timestamp for the whole point cloud, so we'll use the first
point's timestamp. We'll pack each field as a four byte single-precision little-endian float.

We start by describing our data layout in the ``foxglove.PointCloud`` message:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/jsonschema/pointcloud_csv_to_mcap.py
    :start-after: # tutorial-point-layout-start
    :end-before: # tutorial-point-layout-end
    :dedent:

And pack the points using Python's built-in ``struct`` and ``base64`` libraries.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/jsonschema/pointcloud_csv_to_mcap.py
    :start-after: # tutorial-pack-points-start
    :end-before: # tutorial-pack-points-end
    :dedent:

In Foxglove Studio, each 3D object exists in its own coordinate frame. A point cloud's ``frame_id``
identifies which coordinate frame it belongs in, and its ``pose`` determines its relative position
from that coordinate frame's center.

Since we will only have one coordinate frame in our MCAP file, we can choose any string as our
``frame_id``, and use the identity pose to place our point cloud in its center.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/jsonschema/pointcloud_csv_to_mcap.py
    :start-after: # tutorial-pose-frame-id-start
    :end-before: # tutorial-pose-frame-id-end
    :dedent:

Writing the MCAP file
---------------------

Now that the point cloud is built, we can write it into an MCAP file. We'll start with some imports
from the `Python MCAP library <https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/tree/main/python>`_:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/jsonschema/pointcloud_csv_to_mcap.py
    :start-after: # tutorial-mcap-imports-start
    :end-before: # tutorial-mcap-imports-end
    :dedent:

Let's open a file where we'll write our output MCAP data. First, we'll need to write our header.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/jsonschema/pointcloud_csv_to_mcap.py
    :start-after: # tutorial-write-header-start
    :end-before: # tutorial-write-header-end
    :dedent:

Next, create a "channel" of messages to contain our point cloud. The schema
name and content informs Foxglove Studio that it can parse and display this message as a point
cloud.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/jsonschema/pointcloud_csv_to_mcap.py
    :start-after: # tutorial-write-channel-start
    :end-before: # tutorial-write-channel-end
    :dedent:

Next, we write our message.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/jsonschema/pointcloud_csv_to_mcap.py
    :start-after: # tutorial-write-message-start
    :end-before: # tutorial-write-message-end
    :dedent:

Finally, we invoke ``finish()`` on the MCAP writer to include the summary and footer
in the output file.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/jsonschema/pointcloud_csv_to_mcap.py
    :start-after: # tutorial-finish-start
    :end-before: # tutorial-finish-end
    :dedent:

That's it! We now have a valid MCAP file with 10 point cloud messages. We can
check this with the `MCAP CLI tool <https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/tree/main/go/cli/mcap>`_.
First, install it with Homebrew on Mac (or download a release binary from
`GitHub <https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/releases>`):

.. code-block:: bash

  $ brew install mcap

Run the following commands to summarize your fileâ€™s contents and to verify that it has no issues:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mcap info output.mcap
  library: python mcap 0.0.11
  profile:

  end: 2011-11-04T01:36:05.987339008+11:00 (1320330965.987339008)

  channels:

  attachments: 0
  $ mcap doctor output.mcap
  Examining output.mcap

For a more visual representation of this data, let's use Foxglove Studio. Open either the
`desktop <https://foxglove.dev/download>`_ or `web app <https://studio.foxglove.dev>`_, and add a
`RawMessages <https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/panels/raw-messages>`_ and a
 `3D (Beta) <https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/panels/3d-beta>`_ panel to your layout.

Then, simply drag and drop your output MCAP file into the app window to start playing the data. Make
sure to enable the ``pointcloud`` topic in the 3D (Beta) panel to display the point cloud in 3D
space.
